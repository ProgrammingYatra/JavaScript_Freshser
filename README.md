### Created Two Branches :
1. Part_1,
2. Part_2.


## Part 1 :-
Advance user 
Candidate should have to create the individual function (arrow function’s) for each question asked.

Array and Strings 
Let defaultarrvalue = [‘astra’,’book’, ‘paper’, ‘bus’, ‘deep’, ‘nehal’]
Create the input field from where we can add the data.

A candidate can’t use “for loop”; use the different function for looping over the array if needed. Candidate should make use of map (), reduce (), find (), and filter () methods instead of for loop.
